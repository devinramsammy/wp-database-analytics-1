## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
In the United States Data show that police kill civilian more than  any other countries. The most affected by this are the
African American community. By numbers white people are fatally shot by police more than any other race, however; if we look
at it based on the demographic, then African Americans suffers almost 3 times more police shooting than the white.


## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
For our website, you can track which states are the most affected by going zooming through the map.
Moreover, you can get to visualize the rate of the police shooting through the different bar charts.


## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>
Because of lack of federal database of police shooting to the public, we had to use the Washington Post database.
Even though the Washington Post usually updated the information on the police shooting, but there were still some
missing pieces such as people who died while in police custody police shooting by off duty officiers.

We had to use technology that we know we will have eniough time to learn and be able to use during the 24 hour
because mostly we were newby with this teachnology.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
Even though our website anaylitics mostly focuses on police shooting, however; we can make our website use any routes
such as which races are suffering the most in mental illness. In addition, we can even keep track of which states are
affected through the most with COVID19. The way our website's design, we just need the right data to visualize any 
differences bvetween states and races in the US.
